# House Price Prediction
 




## 1. Introduction
 
1. Overview of the project and its objectives.
2. Description of the dataset used (features like area, number of bedrooms, location, etc.).
3. Importance of predicting house prices in the real estate industry.




##  2. Dataset Description

1. Source of the dataset.
2. Explanation of the features and target variable.
3. Data preprocessing steps (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).




## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Insights derived from the data (distribution of house prices, feature distributions).
2. Visualization techniques used (histograms, bar plots, etc.).
3. Correlation analysis to understand relationships between features and target variable.


## 4. Data Preprocessing

1. Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
2. Encoding of categorical variables.
3. Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
4. Standardization/Normalization of features.






## 5. Model Selection

2. Comparison of the results from different models.
3. Discussion on model accuracy and potential improvements.
## 8. Prediction and Visualization

1. Visualization of predicted vs actual house prices.
2. Residual analysis to check the normality of errors.
3. Feature importance analysis (for models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting).



## 9. Conclusion 

1. Summary of findings and results.
2. Discussion on the model's effectiveness in predicting house prices.
3. Potential areas for future work (e.g., using more advanced models, gathering more data, etc.).
